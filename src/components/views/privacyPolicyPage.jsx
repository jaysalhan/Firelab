          We provide reasonable and appropriate security measures in connection
          with securing Personal Information we collect. For example, we:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Constantly work to update our security practices to implement

          </li>
          <li>

          <b>7. Safeguarding Your Information</b>

        <p>
          We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect Personal
          Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
          alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in
          the processing and the nature of the Personal Information.
        </p>
        <p>
          FireLab accounts require a username and password to log in. You must
          keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a
          third party. Account passwords are encrypted, which means we cannot
          see your passwords. We cannot resend forgotten passwords either. We
          will only reset them.

          The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides California
          residents rights regarding the collection and use of their personal
          information, subject to certain exceptions. An authorized party may
          submit requests on your behalf. The authorized party must provide a
          valid power of attorney, or proof of registration with the California
          Secretary of State as an authorized agent on your behalf.

        <p>Generally, California residents have the following rights:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To request a disclosure of the personal information that has been
            collected; the categories of sources from which the information was

            with which the personal information may be shared; and access to the
            specific personal information in a portable format.
          </li>
          <li>

            consumer, subject to certain exceptions.
          </li>

            any time please send us an email at: hello@firelabinc.com

          <li>
            To not be denied a product or service, charged a different price or
            rate, or denied a discount or other benefit because the consumer
            exercised any of his/her rights under the CCPA.&nbsp;
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Who does CCPA apply to?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          CCPA applies to California residents only. For purposes of CCPA, a
          California resident is a person who currently lives in California, or
          is domiciled in California but is outside of the state for a temporary
          or transitory purpose. The rights described above do not apply to
          residents of other U.S. states or persons who reside outside of the
          United States.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          There are certain activities, information, and circumstances involving
          the collection, use, processing, sale, or disclosure of personal
          information that are exempt or excluded from CCPA. CCPA exemptions and
          exclusions include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; Personal information collected or sold if every aspect of the
          commercial transaction takes place wholly outside of California.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; Deidentified or aggregate consumer information.</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp; GLBA:The CCPA does not apply to personal information collected,
          processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and
          its implementing regulations (GLBA). GLBA is the federal law that
          regulates the collection, disclosure, and safeguarding of individuals'
          nonpublic personal information who obtain financial products or
          services primarily for personal, family, or household purposes from a
          financial institution. For example, if you are a California resident
          and you have a personal financial product with us, such as a personal
          credit card, the CCPA rights do not apply to the personal information
          associated with that account. There are other types of personal
          information that are not covered by the rights and limitations in the
          CCPA. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Fair Credit Reporting Act: CCPA does not apply to any activity
          involving the collection, maintenance, disclosure, sale,
          communication, or use of any personal information bearing on an
          individual's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity,
          character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of
          living by a consumer reporting agency, user or furnisher of consumer
          reports as defined under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. &nbsp;

        <p>
          Business-to-Business Relationships: Until January 1, 2021, CCPA access
          and deletion requests do not apply to personal information that (1)
          reflects written or verbal communications or transactions between
          FireLab and you, and (2) was collected while you were acting in the
          capacity of an employee, owner, officer, director, or contractor of a
          company, in the context of FireLab's business relationship with that
          company. For these purposes, a company includes sole proprietors,
          partnerships, non-profits, and government entities. &nbsp;

          personal information from a child under the age of thirteen without
          the consent of that child's parent or guardian. The statements in this
          Privacy Policy about our collection and use of personal information
          also apply to our treatment of personal information from children
          under the age of thirteen. Some elements of our Services such as
          signing up for our Services require the submission of a payment card
          number along with personal information in connection with a purchase;
          other elements of our Services require the submission of personal
          information to access or use the Services. Except in certain cases
          where limited contact information may be collected and not retained,
          these elements of our Services are not available to children under the
          age of thirteen. If a child who we know to be under the age of
          thirteen and for whom we have not received parental consent attempts
          to utilize a service on our Services which is not available to
          children, he/she will not be able to access it and may receive a
